# hexo-tag-markdown
This repository contains an attempt to allow the insertion of Liquid-like tags (of the form `{% include_markdown %}`) into Hexo blogs, in order to include content from other markdown files in markdown posts.

See [here](https://github.com/fusion809/hexo-site/blob/master/source/_posts/free-operating-systems.md#footnotes) (raw: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusion809/hexo-site/master/source/_posts/free-operating-systems.md) for an example of this plugin being used on an Hexo site.
