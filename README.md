# hexo-tag-markdown
This repository contains an attempt to allow the insertion of Liquid-like tags (of the form `{% include_markdown %}`) into Hexo blogs, in order to include content from other markdown files in markdown posts.

See [here](https://github.com/fusion809/hexo-site/blob/240c8f27b7bf31349d15fff3a1d05c061b40a4b1/source/_posts/free-operating-systems.md#footnotes) for an example of this plugin being used on an Hexo site, unsuccessfully as of commit aace790 of this repository.
